# Questions

## Question 1: Explain the test

Can you explain why a runtime failure happens? It seems that the operation will success since all the base class can be assigned by a derived one.

## Question 2: Solution

How other collection types like Stack<T> and List<T> prevent such failure from happening. If you re-produce the test with such types, will your code compile?

## Question 3: Co-variance and Contra-variance on class or interface

Is co-variance and contra-variance happen on interfaces or classes? How to support variance (both co-variance and contra-variance) on a type?

## Question 4: Co-variance and Contra-variance

Can you explain what is a co-variance and contra-variance?
